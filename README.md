- 👋 Hi, I’m @0Picass0 and I am a total noobie!!
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux Mint, Zorin and maybe more. I really want to escape Microsoft / Windows. I use Kodi with Diggz Xenon Burst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the Terminal in Mint 21.3 Virginia Cinnamon. Always looking to improve performance of the OS and Kodi I use and learn new skills.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ummmm ...I'm not quite sure what this is about, she, her, hers, I guess.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I live in a country where English is not spoken much and technology is slow and behind the times.
- A lot of people I follow on YouTube, and devs for Kodi apps, use Github, so thats why I'm here!
